<ul>
<h2><u>First Day In Madrid</u></h2>

		<li><p>We started the day by landing at the Barajas airport at 10:00, when we took a direct metro line 203 from terminal 2 to the station Cibeles at the city center. when we arrived to the <a href="https://hoteldelasletras.iberostar.com/en" target="_blank">Hotel Iberostar Las Letras Gran Via.</p></a>
		
		<li><p>After freshening up and organized in the room we went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_V%C3%ADa,_Madrid" target="_blank">Gran Via</a> street for shoping. On the street itself you can find a variety of clothing stores including Primark, H&M, Zarz, Mango, Bershka and for football fans the official store of Real Madrid.Also on the street you can find a variety of fast food and restaurants that we will recommend and expand on later.</p></li>
		
		<li><p>When we started to get hungry after walking and shopping we decided to go eat at <a href="https://mercadodesanmiguel.es/en/" target="_blank"> Mercado de San Miguel</a> who known for a wide variety of foods such as cheeses, seafood, asian food, meats, vegetarian, tapas and of course alcohol. which is not far from the Gran via Street.</p></li>
		
		<li><p>So after we ate we continued walking to the two most famous squares in the city <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Mayor,_Madrid" target="_blank">Plaza Mayor</a> & <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerta_del_Sol_(Madrid)" target="_blank">Puerto Del Sol</a>.<br/><b>Puerto Del Sol</b> as its name is built is a semi round square full of shops and sometimes there are also street performances in the square when from the square there are exits to alleys		that look like sun rays where you can also find shops and food stalls.<br/><b>Plaza Mayor</b> is built in a rectangular shape surrounded by residential buildings with only 3 floors and there are 9 exits from the square and it is located near to Puerto Del Sol Square. In the place you can find a variety of tapas and alcohol restaurants and historical information about the place which includes several historical statues.</p></li>
		
		<li><p>Our next destination was the roof top bar <a href="https://tickets.circulobellasartes.com/en/" target="_blank"> Círculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid</a> what is special about this bar is that it has a view over the whole center of Madrid. In the place you can find a variety of alcoholic drinks and cocktails and of course there are also snacks and food for those who are hungry, we decided to come for a few drinks and a rest from the walks. Note that the entrance costs 5.50 euros and it is recommended to buy in advance on the website.</li></p>
	
		<li><p>So after resting a bit and drinking a few cocktails we moved towards<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_de_Cibeles" target="_blank"> Plaza Cibeles</a> which is not far from the bar. This is a famous and central square in Madrid, which over the years has become one of the symbols of the city, as the football and basketball teams of Real Madrid usually celebrate winning titles in the square. Even if you don't like sports, it is recommended to come and be impressed by it.</li></p>
		
		<li><p>Afterwards we returned to the hotel to get ready for dinner at the <a href="https://www.bigmammagroup.com/en/trattorias/bel-mondo" target="_blank"> Bel Mundo</a> restaurant. It is a highly recommended Italian restaurant with a diverse menu. We decided to go for truffle and cheese pasta, which was prepared in a Parmesan wheel right at our table, and it was absolutely delicious. We personally decided to skip dessert because our next stop was another bar, and we didn't want to load on the stomach.</li></p>

		<li><p>Our next stop was <a href="https://inclanbrutalbar.com/" target="_blank">Inclan Brutal bar</a>, a very colorful bar with great music. The place offers a variety of alcohol and snacks, and even food dishes for those who are hungry. What makes this bar unique and different from others is that every cocktail comes in a unique and cool glass. Beyond the design of the glasses, the cocktails were really high-quality, so for all cocktail lovers, don't miss out on this place.</li></p>

<h3><u>Second Day In Madrid</u></h3>


	<li><p>We woke up at 7:00 AM because we wanted to make the most of the planned attractions, and since they are not in the city center we needed to get around by buses and metro. So we started with breakfast at the hotel which was included in our package. For those who don't have breakfast included, Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts which can be found on every corner will do the job.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>So after finishing breakfast we started our journey to the <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/sites/en/tour-bernabeu" target="_blank">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> home of the Real Madrid football team. We went to the nearby bus stop at Círculo De Bellas Artes, and took bus line 150 to Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (which is also the name of the stop).
			Upon arriving at the stadium, we reached the entrance for the tour. It's worth mentioning that it's recommended to buy tickets in advance rather than at the venue, as the chances of finding tickets on the spot are slim. You can find a link under the stadium's name.
			The tour can be either self-guided or with a guide. We preferred a self-guided tour to walk at our own pace. The tour includes visiting the pitch and various areas, offering a panoramic view of the stadium, and entry to the museum, which showcases the history of the stadium and Real Madrid, including a close-up view of the team's famous trophies.At the end of the tour, you can find an official club store for souvenirs. This attraction is highly recommended for football fans,
			and even those who are not fans will find it interesting due to the impressive and grand structure that is an integral part of Madrid.It's advisable to check which bus or metro line closest to you goes there, as there are several lines that reach the stadium.</p></li>
	
	<li><p> After finishing the tour at the stadium, we decided to go eat at a place called <a href="https://federalcafe.es/madrid-comendadoras/" target="_blank">Café Federal</a> that located in the city center. So we returned to the city center from Santiago Bernabéu station we took line 10 to Puerta Del Sur station and then walked to the café. Upon arriving we waited in a queue that wasn't particularly long until a table became available. It's a neighborhood café that offers a variety of breakfast dishes as well as cold and hot drinks. Those who are unsure can find a menu on the website. </p></li>
	
	<li><p> Our next destination was the <a href="https://www.zoomadrid.com/en" target="_blank">Madrid Zoo Aquarium</a>. After finishing our dinner, we walked to Plaza de España station then took bus line 10 to Casa de Campo station. Upon arriving at the station, we had to walk about 10 minutes to the zoo entrance. At the entrance, we presented the tickets we had purchased in advance (it's recommended to buy tickets ahead of time to avoid lines).
			The zoo is a very large complex, so it's advisable to allocate at least 3-4 hours, or even more if you have childrens, as the walking route between the animals is long. There is a wide variety of animals to see, including lions, tigers, wolves, kangaroos, koalas, pandas, and many more including a large aquarium and a large monkey enclosure.
			Additionally, there are dolphin and parrot shows every few hours. It's important to check the zoo’s operating hours and show times, as they may vary depending on holidays and seasons. There are also diners for food, drinks, and snacks if you want to take a break. This is a must-visit attraction for all ages and is very enjoyable. </p></li>
	
	<li><p> After we finished exploring the zoo, we returned to the hotel to rest and get ready for dinner at <a href="https://lacabanaargentina.es/en" target="_blank"> La Cabaña Argentina</a>.this is an Argentine steakhouse with a menu that includes a variety of starters, salads, seafood, and, of course, meats. Additionally, for those who do not eat meat, the restaurant also offers Italian dishes. It is also recommended to make a reservation in advance here as well.</p></li>

	<li><p> After the restaurant we went to <a href="https://teatrokapital.com/en/" target="_blank">Teatro Kapital club</a>, a very unique and well-known club in Madrid. What makes this club special is that it has 5 floors, each featuring a different style of music, with each floor having its own uniq.
			For example, the second floor is dedicated to karaoke, while the fifth floor plays reggaeton.Please note that it’s a good idea to check the club’s website for the dress code, as it may vary depending on the day. As with any popular venue, it's recommended to buy tickets in advance, although it's not required. </p></li>

<h4><u>Third Day In Madrid</u></h4>

	<li><p> On the third day we started at 08:00 with breakfast at the hotel. After that we headed to Gran Via street, where we began walking towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerta_de_Alcal%C3%A1" target="_blank">Puerta de Alcalá</a> monument that located at Plaza de la Independencia. Along the way we took advantage of the time to shoping on the street itself. The square is very impressive and large, with the monument in the middle being quite beautiful and magnificent, making it worth a visit. </p></li>
	
	<li><p> From the square we continued to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parque_del_Buen_Retiro,_Madrid" target="_blank">Retiro Park</a>, which is nearby. It is the main park of Madrid, very large, and it is recommended to set aside two to three hours or even more to explore and fully enjoy it. You can even have a picnic if you wish. On weekends, you can find street performances and musicians in the park. There are also food and drink stalls. In the park, you can find several beautiful and unique spots such as the lake in the center of the park, the Crystal Palace, and the Rose Garden. It is recommended to stroll around the park and fully explore it as you can find stunning corners of gardening and tree and plant designs. </p></li>
	
	<li><p>After we took a walk at the park, we continued to our next attraction, the <a href="https://ikono.global/en/madrid" target="_blank">Ikono</a> Museum. This is an "Instegram" museum, not the type of painting museum that we know. It is filled with beautiful effects and illusions. It is highly recommended to visit as the photos you take there will be very beautiful. Overall, it is a really nice and highly recommended experience, especially for families.</p></li>
	
	<li><p>After the walk in the park and the visit in the museum, we started to get hungry, especially with a big evening still ahead of us. So from the museum, we went to <a href="https://www.oven.es/" target="_blank">Oven</a>, a highly recommended Italian restaurant in Madrid with many branches spread throughout the city, so you are sure to find one near you. The restaurant offers a variety of dishes from Italian cuisine. We started with focaccia, which was excellent, and for the main course, we had two pizzas. The dough was very airy, and overall, the pizza was truly superb. It is a highly recommended place for both dinner and lunch. It is advisable to make a reservation in advance. </p></li>
	
	<li><p> So after we ate, the moment we had been waiting for finally arrived. In fact, it was the reason we came to Madrid and was actually a birthday gift from my fiancée and a personal dream come true watching the football match between Real Madrid and Barcelona. This is one of the most watched football matches in the world and one of the greatest rivalries in football.
				I have been to Real Madrid games before but not such a big game against Barcelona. So, we arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium to watch the game, which was an incredible experience. The stadium was packed with over 85,000 spectators, and of course, there was a super dramatic 3-2 victory in the 91st minute. So until next time, goodbye Madrid and thank you for being amazing as always. </p></li>
